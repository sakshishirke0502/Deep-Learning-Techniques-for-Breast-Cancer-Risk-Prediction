Deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are increasingly utilized for predicting breast cancer risk by analyzing medical imaging data. By automatically extracting intricate features from mammograms, CNNs enhance diagnostic accuracy and enable earlier detection of potential malignancies .
By harnessing the power of AI, we can empower healthcare professionals to provide more accurate, efficient, and personalized care for breast cancer patients . 

The Challenge : Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment. Traditional methods, while effective, can be time-consuming and prone to human error . 


The Solution : Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer a powerful, data-driven approach to analyze medical images, such as mammograms. By training CNNs on large datasets of annotated images, we can develop models capable of accurately identifying subtle patterns indicative of cancerous tissue .
